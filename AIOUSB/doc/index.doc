<h2>Introduction</h2>
AIOUSB is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from
annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming 
languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL 
(Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D.

Doxygen can help you in three ways:
<ol>
<li> It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an 
     off-line reference manual (in \LaTeX) from a set 
     of documented source files. 
     There is also support for generating output in RTF (MS-Word), 
     PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man pages.
     The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which
     makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the
     source code.
<li> You can also use doxygen for creating normal documentation (as I did
     for the doxygen user manual and web-site).
</ol>

AIOUSB is developed under Mac OS X and Linux, but is set-up to be highly 
portable. As a result, it runs on most other Unix flavors as well. 
Furthermore, executables for Windows are available.

This manual is divided into three parts, each of which is divided into several sections.

The first part forms a user manual:
<ul>

<li>Section \ref install discusses how to 
      <a href="http://github.com/accesio/AIOUSB">download</a>, compile and install
                     doxygen for your platform.
<li>Section \ref aiousb tells you about the AIOUSB C and C++ libraries.
<li>Section \ref classlib tells you about the AIOUSB CLASSLIB C++ libraries.

</ul>

The second part forms a reference manual:

The third part provides information for developers:

<h2>User examples</h2>

Doxygen supports a number of \ref output "output formats" where HTML is the
most popular one. I've gathered 
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/results.html">some nice examples</a> 
of real-life projects using doxygen.

These are part of a larger
<a href="http://www.doxygen.org/projects.html">list of projects</a> 
that use doxygen.
If you know other projects, let <a href="mailto:jdamon@accesio.com?subject=New%20project%20using%20Doxygen">me</a> 
know and I'll add them. 

<h2>Future work</h2>
Although doxygen is successfully used by large number of companies and 
open source projects already, there is always room for improvement. 
<p>
You can submit enhancement requests in
<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?product=doxygen&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_severity=enhancement">the bug tracker</a>.
Make sure the severity of the bug report is set to "enhancement".
